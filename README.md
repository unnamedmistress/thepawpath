# thepawpath


## Description

- Our motivation was to give the user an opportunity to provide a forever home to that lucky pet. 
- We wanted to supply the user with information and direct location to the shelter.
- We've made the ThePawPath app to show the capabilities of APIs and how current day technology is used to make webpages/apps that's beyond our imagination.
